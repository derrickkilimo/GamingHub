### Description:

GamersHub is a web application that allows users to discover and explore video games. The application fetches data from the RAWG API to display a list of games released between 2013-01-01 and 2023-08-01. Users can view game details, including the game's name, platforms, rating, and release date.

The application features a responsive layout using Bootstrap for easy navigation on various devices. It also includes a "Load More" button that dynamically fetches and displays additional games.

Additionally, there is a search functionality that allows users to search for games by their name. When a search term is entered and the search button is clicked, the application fetches and displays the games that match the search term.

Project Setup Instructions:

To run the GamersHub application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

The application will automatically fetch and display a list of video games on the initial load.

To load more games, click on the "Load More" button at the bottom of the page.

To search for specific games, enter the game name in the search input field and click the "Search" button.

The application will fetch and display the games that match the search term.

That's it! You can now explore and discover various video games on GamersHub.

Note:

Please ensure that you have an active internet connection to fetch data from the RAWG API. If you encounter any issues or errors while using the application, please check the browser console for error messages, and make sure you have CORS enabled for the API, or use a server to proxy the API requests if needed.
